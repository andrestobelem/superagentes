# AI Agents Development Guidelines

## Agent Architecture
- Design agents with clear, single responsibilities
- Use modular design for agent components
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Consider agent state management and persistence

## Agent Communication
- Define clear interfaces for agent interactions
- Use structured data formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers)
- Implement proper logging for agent actions and decisions
- Design for asynchronous communication patterns

## Agent Behavior
- Make agent decisions transparent and explainable
- Implement configurable agent parameters
- Use proper prompt engineering techniques
- Consider safety and ethical guidelines

## Code Organization
- Separate agent logic from infrastructure code
- Use dependency injection for agent components
- Implement proper configuration management
- Create reusable agent utilities and helpers

## Testing AI Agents
- Mock external AI services for testing
- Test agent decision-making logic separately
- Create integration tests for agent workflows
- Use deterministic testing approaches where possible

## Documentation
- Document agent capabilities and limitations
- Include examples of agent usage
- Explain agent decision-making processes
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues
