# Testing and Code Quality Standards

## Test Structure
- Place tests in `tests/` directory or name test files with `test_` prefix
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Test functions should start with `test_`
- Test classes should start with `Test`

## Test Coverage
- Aim for high test coverage (80%+)
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Test error conditions and exception handling
- Write integration tests for complex workflows

## Test Organization
- Group related tests in classes
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Use fixtures for common test setup
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Code Quality
- Run Black formatter before committing
- Use type hints consistently
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow single responsibility principle

## Before Committing
- Run tests locally
- Ensure Black formatting is applied
- Check that imports are properly organized
- Verify all code is in English
